    <p>
      Dr. Ciarán Shaughnessy <strong>teaches physiology and mentors research students</strong> in the Department of Integrative Biology. His teaching emphasizes clarity, inclusive practices, and active engagement with complex material. In both the classroom and the lab, he aims to support students in <strong>developing confidence, critical thinking skills, and durable strategies for learning and scientific inquiry</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="secondary">Teaching</span><span class="highlight">Philosophy</span></h2>

    <p>
      I am deeply committed to my role as an educator and mentor. My approach to teaching is grounded in principles of <strong>active learning and structured reflection</strong>. I aim to establish a connection with students based on <strong>mutual respect and trust</strong>, and I view myself not simply as a source of knowledge, as a facilitator of learning and growth. I recognize that students come from diverse backgrounds with different learning needs and styles, and I strive to build classroom environments that are inclusive, equitable, and engaging.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strive to clearly communicate expectations, provide predictable structure, and offer low-stakes opportunities for students to practice skills before assessments. I design my courses to challenge students in a supportive environment such that they are able to take ownership of their learning process. <strong>I want to help my students to develop independence and curiosity</strong>, and I aim to guide them toward a deeper understanding of both content and process.
    </p>

    <h4 class="teaching-label">Pedagogy</h4>
    <p>
      My courses use structured reflection, transparent grading, and <strong>interactive and reflective tools</strong> like iClicker to foster engagement. I aim to support student motivation by offering choices, accessible review opportunities, and opportunities to <strong>practice without penalty</strong>. I believe this creates space for students to develop confidence and <strong>build mastery at their own pace</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4 class="teaching-label">Education Science Interests</h4>
    <p>
      I am an avid consumer and practitioner of insights gleaned from education science, particularly with respect to the teaching of college-level physiology. I stay current with journals such as <em>Advances in Physiology Education</em>, attend workshops, trainings, and seminars in physiology education, and seek to <strong>apply my training in enhancing the learning environment and student performance in my classroom</strong>. I take my teaching seriously and treat it as a discipline in its own right, much the same way I do my research.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="secondary">Current</span><span class="highlight">Courses</span></h2>
    <p>
      I currently teach physiology and supervise research students at Oklahoma State University. My teaching includes large lecture-based courses, lab instruction, and individual mentorship through undergraduate and graduate research credits.

      <span class="secondary">BIOL 3204, "</span><span class="highlight">Physiology</span><span class="secondary">"</span>
    </h3>
    
    <p>
     BIOL 3204, "Physiology" is a 4-credit hour course (lecture and laboratory) that introduces students to <strong>principles of vertebrate physiological processes and their underlying anatomical, cellular, molecular features</strong>, with a primary focus on human systems.The lecture component emphasizes systems-level understanding, critical thinking, and practice-based learning through in-class iClicker questions, take-home assignments, and review opportunities. The lab is designed to reinforce lecture content with hands-on investigation and small-group collaboration. Students collect and interpret physiological data and engage in guided scientific inquiry throughout the semester.
    </p>

    <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Teaching Approach</h4>
    <p>
        My approach to teaching BIOL 3204 emphasizes clarity, structure, and <strong>support for diverse learners in a large-enrollment setting</strong>. I aim to make expectations explicit and to provide students with frequent, low-stakes opportunities to practice and receive feedback. I draw on active learning principles, including <strong>real-time polling, structured review, and reflective assignments</strong>, to help students build mastery gradually and intentionally. I also value intellectual flexibility: students can explore the material through creative or <strong>self-directed activities</strong> that suit their interests and strengths. Across both lecture and lab, I work to create a culture of transparency, empathy, and scientific curiosity.
    </p>

    <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Lecture Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Typically, multiple lecture sections (each with 150-240 students) are offered each semester. The lecture is structured as <strong>a survey of major physiological systems</strong> (i.e,, endocrine, nervous, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune). Graded activities include weekly homework assignments (10 total), daily in-class iClicker participation, midterms (4 total, lowest dropped), and a final exam. Additionally, there are extra credit opportunities to <strong>encourage students to engage in varied and reflective experiences with the material</strong>, including weekly homework activities (e.g., drawing, writing, using computer-based models and simulations, wathcing and reflecting on videos, reading and reflecting on non-fiction book chapters, etc.).
    </p>

    </p>

    <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Lab Overview</h4>
    <p>
     Students select a weekly 2-hour lab section (each with typically 18-24 students) along with their lecture section. The laboratory is designed to reinforce lecture concepts through guided, hands-on activities in which <strong>students use clinically relevant analytical devices to measure their own physiological processes in real time</strong>. Students complete 12 graded lab modules throughout the semester, each requiring pre-lab assignments, in-lab participation, and engagement with physiological experiments. Graded components include attendance and participation, bi-weekly quizzes (6 total, lowest dropped), and a <strong>lab report on real physiological data collected during lab and written modeled after scientific journal articles</strong>. The lab report writing process includes a rough draft, peer review workshop, and a final submission.

    <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Student Feedback</h4>
    <p>
     I have taught over 500 students in BIOL 3204 since I joined the Department in Spring 2024. I have gotten to know some exceptionally talented students at OSU over this time, and student feedback on the course has been overwhelmingly positive. I find students tend to appreciate the structured approach of the class, the interactive nature of the lecture, and the <strong>emphasis on understanding rather than memorization</strong>. The most rewarding feedback is from students who find that the course has helped them develop thier independent and critical thinking skills and <strong>a deeper appreciation for physiology as a discipline</strong>.
