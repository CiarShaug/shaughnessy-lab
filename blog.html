        <p class="blog-text">This summer, the Shaughnessy Lab has 6 people working in the lab on research assistantships: all 5 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student. We were able to get the whole lab (and partners/spouses) together for dinner at our house.</p>

          <h3 class="blog-title">Welcome to a fellow New Englander, Susanne Hahs!</h3>
          <p class="blog-text">Susanne Hahs is joining us for an M.S. after recently graduating from Boston College. She will be working on the functional evolution of receptors in the HPI axis.</p>
          <p class="blog-text">Susanne was originally supposed to be joining us as an NSF RaMP Fellow and work in the lab as a full-time researcher for the next year. However, our multi-year NSF RaMP Program grant in the department was abruptly terminated. The reach of these historic cuts to science is enormous, and even our labs here in the more conservative-leaning states and public universities are being hit hard as well. The NSF RaMP Program was a highly impactful program for training the next generation of scientists, and our program has brought many jobs to Stillwater. It has been sad to see it end too early.</p>
          <p class="blog-text">Luckily, we were still able to take Susanne on as a graduate student. I am thrilled to have someone in the lab working on receptor evolution! So, we will be firing back up the luciferase reporter gene assay that I used to run a lot at the University of Denver as an NSF Fellow. We are really starting to assemble lots of different tools in the lab now.</p>

    <p class="blog-text">Allison and I traveled to Québec City for the North American Society of Comparative Endocrinologists meeting. It was wonderful bringing a student along to a conference. The science and socializing were fantastic, as they always are at NASCE. The poutine was... interesting, as it always is in Quebec. We brought home lots of good ideas. Of course, I brought back some maple-flavored lollipops for my toddler at home.</p>

    <h3 class="blog-title">Recapping 2024</h3>
    <p class="blog-text">What a year 2024 was... the new lab is coming together, and I thought I should start logging this adventure.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">In the spring, I had my first undergraduate students at OSU join me in the lab and it was a blast. Their presence really helped us get going on some of the basic molecular biology assays we have going on in the lab.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">In the summer, I attended the International Congress on the Biology of Fish in Ann Arbor, MI. This has always been my favorite conference. Now that I am the treasurer of the AFS Physiology Section (the society that puts on ICBF), the conference is a bit more work, but still great fun. The science is always good! Also, in the early Fall, I attended the International Symposium on Fish Encodrinology in Baltimore, MD. What fun!</p>
    <p class="blog-text">In the Fall, Allison DeLoache (B.S., Clemson Univ; M.S., Southeastern LA Univ) and Dillon Flowers (B.S., Weber St Univ; M.S. UT Tyler) joined the lab as PhD students after completing their Master's degrees elsewhere. Allison will be working on environmental and chronic stress physiology, and already has a project lined up with ODWC to compare thermal tolerance of introduced and native smallmouth bass. Dillon will be working on intestinal ion transport processes in the intestine of marine fishes (including, of course, sea lamprey).</p>
    <p class="blog-text">Also in the Fall, we had our first arrivals of Atlantic killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) to the lab. They are from New Hampshire, and hardy New Englanders like me.</p>

      </a>
      <p class="blog-caption">Wetlab racks prior to arrival of fish.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="blog-text">Still trying to track down some lamprey for the lab...</p>
    <p class="blog-text">Of course, we got out some grant proposals in to the GLFC, NSF, and NIH (none were funded), and we also got out some papers (though this was probably my lowest-productivity year in a while... everyone tells me it will be this way at the beginning, but it is still unsatisfying). We do have some exciting papers in review now, set to come out early next year.</p>
    <p class="blog-text">So, it's on to next year!</p>
